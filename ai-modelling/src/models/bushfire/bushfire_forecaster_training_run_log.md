## Leading model

**Run 4: ConvLSTM–BiLSTM** has the best test-set PR-AUC logged (0.1335) and perfect precision (1.0000), the best-supported pick on the primary (threshold-independent) metric.

**Run 3**, a matched M1 baseline with BiLSTM turned off, is the most directly relevant comparison: it uses the same 2019 train / Jan–Mar 2020 val / Dec 10–31 2021 eval setup as Run 4, giving the closest controlled BiLSTM-vs-no-BiLSTM comparison in this log. Under this near-matched setup, BiLSTM wins on PR-AUC and precision, while the plain baseline has higher recall and F2 (0.1476 vs 0.1220).

| | PR-AUC | F2 | Precision | Recall |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Run 4: BiLSTM** | **0.1335** | 0.1220 | 1.0000 | 0.1000 |
| Run 3: Matched M1 baseline | 0.1016 | **0.1476** | 0.2581 | 0.1333 |
| Run 1: Baseline | 0.0897 | 0.1373 | 0.4667 | 0.1167 |
| Run 6: M1 Baseline (attention comparison) | 0.1002 | 0.0617 | 1.0000 | 0.0500 |

## Field definitions

- **Split policy**: how train/val/test were divided. Either a ratio split or the date-based split.
- **Architecture**: `attention` mode and whether `use_bilstm` / `use_biconvlstm` were enabled. `"none"` + both `False` = the M1 baseline.
- **Total params**: model parameter count.
- **Best val loss**: lowest `MaskedTverskyLoss` or `MaskedFocalLoss` on validation, at the epoch whose weights were reloaded.
- **Threshold**: decision threshold selected on validation by maximizing F2, then applied unchanged to the test set.
- **PR-AUC**: precision-recall area under curve from test-set evaluation, the primary test-set comparison metric since it's threshold-independent (unlike Precision/Recall/F2, which depend on the selected decision threshold). Preferred over ROC-AUC here given how few positive cells are in these test sets.
- **Precision / Recall / F2 / ROC-AUC**: test-set metrics, computed only over valid (land) cells. ROC-AUC is noted as inflated by class imbalance in every run's own log output; compare PR-AUC first.

## Run details

### Run 1: Baseline (2021, restrictive satellite detections)

**Data**
- Grid: `(730, 142, 200, 7)`, a single year (~2021), 12-hourly timesteps
- Valid cells: 14,257 / 28,400 (50.2%)
- Labels: "restrictive" satellite detections, only 976 positive cells across the full grid (positive rate 0.0123%), pos_weight (neg/pos) ≈ 8150

**Split policy** *(legacy, predates the current date-based split)*
- 90% ratio split into train/val (657 timesteps), remaining 10% as test (73 timesteps)
- Train/val further split → train 558 / val 99 timesteps
- Windowed sequences: 528 train / 69 val / 43 test

**Architecture**
- `attention = "none"`, `use_bilstm = False`, `use_biconvlstm = False` (M1 baseline)
- `hidden_size_1 = 32`, `hidden_size_2 = 16`, `dropout = 0.2`
- Total params: 73,937

**Training config**
- Loss: Masked Tversky (`alpha=0.3`, `beta=0.7`)
- Optimizer: Adam, `lr = 0.001`
- `batch_size = 8`, `epochs = 50` (max), `patience = 10`
- `input_steps = 30`, `horizon = 1`

**Outcome**
- Early stopped at epoch 45; best val loss **0.960823** at epoch 35
- Selected threshold: **0.6183** (val F2 = 0.0811)

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| PR-AUC | 0.0897 |
| Skill (vs no-skill PR-AUC 0.0001) | 916.4x |
| Precision | 0.4667 |
| Recall | 0.1167 |
| F2 | 0.1373 |
| F1 | 0.1867 |
| IoU | 0.1029 |
| Brier | 0.0001 |
| ROC-AUC | 0.4946 (inflated by class imbalance) |
| TP / FP / FN / TN | 7 / 8 / 53 / 612,983 |
| Test positive rate | 0.0098% (60 of 613,051 cells) |

**Notes**
- Legacy 90% ratio split on a single year of data, not the current date-based policy; not directly comparable to runs using the newer split.

---

### Run 2: Less restrictive satellite detections (2021)

**Not a clean ablation against Run 1.** In addition to the less-restrictive detection labels, three training-config values also changed from the Run 1 defaults (see below), so differences in outcome can't be attributed to label restrictiveness alone.

**Data**
- Grid: `(730, 142, 200, 7)`, same year/grid as Run 1
- Valid cells: 14,257 / 28,400 (50.2%), same as Run 1
- Labels: less restrictive satellite detections, 9,561 positive cells (vs. 976 in Run 1), positive rate 0.1202% (vs. 0.0123%), pos_weight (neg/pos) ≈ 831.1 (vs. ≈8150)

**Split policy** *(legacy, same as Run 1)*
- 90% ratio split into train/val (657 timesteps), remaining 10% as test (73 timesteps)
- Train/val further split → train 558 / val 99 timesteps
- Windowed sequences: 543 train / 84 val / 58 test (higher than Run 1 because `input_steps` dropped from 30 → 15)

**Architecture**
- `attention = "none"`, `use_bilstm = False`, `use_biconvlstm = False` (M1 baseline), same as Run 1
- `hidden_size_1 = 32`, `hidden_size_2 = 16`, `dropout = 0.2`, same as Run 1
- Total params: 73,937; same as Run 1

**Training config: differences from Run 1 flagged**
- Loss: Masked Tversky (`alpha=0.3`, `beta=0.7`), same as Run 1
- Optimizer: Adam, `lr = 0.001`; same as Run 1
- `batch_size = 8`, same as Run 1
- `input_steps = 15` (Run 1: 30, inferred from "Minimum needed: 16")
- `epochs = 60` (Run 1: 50)
- `patience = 25` (Run 1: 10)

**Outcome**
- Ran the full 60 epochs without early stopping; best val loss **0.866349** at epoch 53
- Selected threshold: **0.0010** (val F2 = 0.1463), notably low, model's positive scores are compressed near 0

| Metric | Value | vs. Run 1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PR-AUC | 0.0278 | ↓ (was 0.0897) |
| Skill (vs no-skill PR-AUC 0.0004) | 72.5x | ↓ (was 916.4x) |
| Precision | 0.0607 | ↓ (was 0.4667) |
| Recall | 0.0599 | ↓ (was 0.1167) |
| F2 | 0.0601 | ↓ (was 0.1373) |
| F1 | 0.0603 | ↓ (was 0.1867) |
| IoU | 0.0311 | ↓ (was 0.1029) |
| Brier | 0.0005 | ↑ (was 0.0001) |
| ROC-AUC | 0.5826 | ↑ (was 0.4946) |
| TP / FP / FN / TN | 19 / 294 / 298 / 826,295 | more of everything (more test windows + more positives) |
| Test positive rate | 0.0383% (317 of 826,906 cells) | ↑ (was 0.0098%) |

**Notes**
- Three hyperparameters changed alongside label restrictiveness (`input_steps`, `epochs`, `patience`), so the test-metric regression can't be attributed to label restrictiveness alone.

---

### Run 3: Matched M1 baseline (2019 data, BiLSTM off)

**Same configuration as Run 4 (ConvLSTM–BiLSTM), with `use_bilstm=False`.** This is the closest controlled BiLSTM-on/BiLSTM-off comparison logged so far, sharing the same 2019 train / Jan–Mar 2020 val / Dec 10–31 2021 eval setup as Run 4.

**Data**
- Training: 2019 (matches current script's `TRAIN_START`/`TRAIN_END`, same as Run 4)
- Validation: January–March 2020 (matches current script's `VAL_TARGET_START`/`VAL_TARGET_END`, same as Run 4)
- Evaluation: **December 10, 2021 12:00 – December 31, 2021 12:00 UTC** (same period as Run 4)
- Training labels: not reported in this log

**Architecture**
- `attention = "none"`, `use_bilstm = False`, `use_biconvlstm = False` (M1 baseline; Run 4 with BiLSTM turned off)
- `hidden_size_1 = 32`, `hidden_size_2 = 16`, `dropout = 0.2` (same defaults as Run 4)
- Total params: 73,937 (inferred from the matching M1 baseline architecture elsewhere in this log; not printed in this run's log)

**Training config**
- Loss: Tversky, `alpha = 0.3`, `beta = 0.7` (same defaults as Run 4)
- Optimizer: Adam, `lr = 0.001`
- `batch_size = 8`, `epochs = 50` (max), `patience = 10`
- `input_steps = 30`

**Outcome**
- Early stopped at epoch 40 (`Wait 10/10`); best val loss **0.670757** at epoch 30
- Selected threshold: **0.8776** (val F2 at threshold selection not reported in this log)

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| PR-AUC | 0.1016 |
| Skill (vs no-skill PR-AUC 0.0001) | 1038.4x |
| Precision | 0.2581 |
| Recall | 0.1333 |
| F2 | 0.1476 |
| F1 | 0.1758 |
| IoU | 0.0964 |
| Brier | 0.0001 |
| ROC-AUC | 0.5995 (inflated by class imbalance) |
| TP / FP / FN / TN | 8 / 23 / 52 / 612,968 |
| Test positive rate | 0.0098% (60 of 613,051 cells) |

**Notes**
- Under the same train/eval period as Run 4, this M1 baseline has higher recall and F2 than BiLSTM (0.1333/0.1476 vs. 0.1000/0.1220), but lower precision and PR-AUC (0.2581/0.1016 vs. 1.0000/0.1335); BiLSTM traded recall for precision here, not a clean win either way.

---

### Run 4: ConvLSTM–BiLSTM

Trained and validated on 2019–2020 data (2019 train, Jan–Mar 2020 val); evaluated on the same period as the other runs in this log.

**Data**
- Training: 2019 (matches current script's `TRAIN_START`/`TRAIN_END`)
- Validation: January–March 2020 (matches current script's `VAL_TARGET_START`/`VAL_TARGET_END`)
- Evaluation: **December 10, 2021 12:00 – December 31, 2021 12:00 UTC** (same period as the other runs in this log)
- Training labels: 7,227 positive cells / 10,214,233 negative cells, positive rate 0.0707%, pos_weight (neg/pos) ≈ 1413.3, a different (larger, "corrected") training-label source than Runs 1–2's 2021 legacy dataset

**Architecture**: confirmed default hyperparameters (not printed in this log, but per script/config defaults)
- ConvLSTM + BiLSTM (`use_bilstm = True`)
- `hidden_size_1 = 32`, `hidden_size_2 = 16`, `dropout = 0.2` (script defaults, same as Run 1)
- `bilstm_hidden_size = 8` (`ForecasterConfig` dataclass default, not overridden anywhere in the script)
- `input_steps = 30` (`INPUT_STEPS` default)

**Training config**
- Loss: Tversky, `alpha = 0.3`, `beta = 0.7` (hardcoded default in `main()`)
- Optimizer: Adam, `lr = 0.001`
- `batch_size = 8` (`BATCH_SIZE` default)
- `epochs = 50` (max), `patience = 10`

**Outcome**
- Early stopped at epoch 27; best val loss **0.738823** at epoch 17
- Selected threshold: **0.8772** (val F2 = 0.6514), notably higher/more confident than Runs 1–2's selected thresholds

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| PR-AUC | 0.1335 |
| Skill (vs no-skill PR-AUC 0.0001) | 1339.3x |
| Precision | 1.0000 |
| Recall | 0.1000 |
| F2 | 0.1220 |
| F1 | 0.1818 |
| IoU | 0.1000 |
| Brier | 0.00009128 |
| ROC-AUC | 0.6491 |
| TP / FP / FN / TN | 6 / 0 / 54 / 602,026 |
| Test positive rate | 0.0100% (60 of 602,086 cell-time targets) |
| Test set | 43 windows × 14,002 spatial cells (Dec 2021) |

**Notes**
- Precision 1.0000, Recall 0.1000: zero false positives but missed 54 of 60 fires, a far more conservative operating point than Runs 1–2. See Run 3 for the closest controlled comparison against the same architecture with BiLSTM off.

---

### Run 5: ConvLSTM–BiConvLSTM (2021, corrected fire labels)

**Different split/mask from Runs 3–4.** This run uses the 2021 legacy grid (same as Runs 1, 2, 6, 7), not Run 3/4's 2019-train / Jan–Mar-2020-val / Dec-2021-eval date-based split, so it isn't directly comparable to Runs 3–4. Its test partition (25 Nov 12:00 – 31 Dec 12:00 2021) resolves to the same window counts as Runs 1, 6, and 7 (528 train / 69 val / 43 test), just expressed here as a 76.5% / 13.5% / 10% chronological split of the 730-timestep grid rather than a nested 90%-then-85/15 split.

**Device:** CUDA, Tesla T4, 1.25 hours, with gradient checkpointing enabled to fit `batch_size=8` in memory

**Data**
- Grid: `(730, 142, 200, 7)`, same 2021 dataset as Runs 1, 6, 7; valid cells 14,257 / 28,400 (50.2%)
- Labels: uses a fire-row alignment correction (`cell_y − 1`) not confirmed as applied in Runs 1/2/6/7/8; training positive count (991) differs slightly from Run 1's (976) as a result, though test positive count (60) matches
- Positive rate (train): 0.0125%, pos_weight (neg/pos) ≈ 8,027
- Partitions: Training 16 Jan 00:00 – 6 Oct 12:00 (528 windows, 991 positive targets); Validation 7 Oct 00:00 – 25 Nov 00:00 (69 windows, 34 positive targets); Test 25 Nov 12:00 – 31 Dec 12:00 (43 windows, 60 positive targets)

**Architecture**
- ConvLSTM + BiConvLSTM (`use_biconvlstm = True`, `use_bilstm = False`, attention disabled)
- `biconvlstm_hidden_size = 8`, `biconvlstm_kernel_size = 3`
- `hidden_size_1 = 32`, `hidden_size_2 = 16`, `dropout = 0.2` (script defaults, unchanged from the committed script per the report)
- Total params: 87,825

**Training config**
- Loss: Tversky, `alpha = 0.3`, `beta = 0.7`
- Optimizer: Adam, `lr = 0.001`
- `batch_size = 8`, `epochs = 50` (max), `patience = 10`
- `input_steps = 30`, `horizon = 1`

**Outcome**
- Early stopped at epoch 22; best val loss **0.999508** at epoch 12 (improved on epoch 1 by less than 0.0004; Tversky loss stayed between 0.9977–0.9995 every epoch, indicating essentially no train-time overlap between predicted and actual fire cells)
- Selected threshold: **0.1982** (val F2 = 0.0007)

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| PR-AUC | 0.0001 |
| Skill (vs no-skill PR-AUC 0.0001) | 0.8x (at/below chance) |
| Precision | 0.00% |
| Recall | 0.00% |
| F1 | 0.0000 |
| F2 | 0.0000 |
| Brier | 0.0008 |
| ROC-AUC | 0.4078 |
| TP / FP / FN / TN | 0 / 3,130 / 60 / 609,861 |
| Test positive rate | 0.0098% (60 of 613,051 cells) |

**Notes**
- Underperformed a trivial persistence baseline (predict "still burning" if burning last step) on every metric: the baseline scored 8/60 true positives (F2 0.1379) vs. this model's 0/60 (F2 0.0000).

### Runs 6 & 7: M1 Baseline vs. M3 Patchwise Self-Attention

**Source:** "FireFusion: ConvLSTM Baseline (M1) vs. Patchwise Self-Attention (M3)" report, Emil Srambikudiyil Daniel

This is the cleanest architecture comparison logged so far: both runs used the **identical cached dataset, split, scaler, and loss function**; the only intentional variable is the attention mechanism. Both also use the same "restrictive satellite detections" 2021 dataset and legacy 90% ratio split as Run 1.

One variable was *not* held constant vs. Run 1 specifically: **`batch_size = 1`** here (reduced from the default 8 "due to GPU memory limits"), whereas Run 1 used `batch=8`. Runs 6 and 7 are directly comparable *to each other*; comparing Run 6 to Run 1 has this batch-size confound.

**Data & split** (identical for both runs, matches Run 1 exactly)
- Grid: `(730, 142, 200, 7)`; valid cells 14,257 / 28,400 (50.2%)
- Split: legacy 90% ratio → train+val 657 steps / test 73 steps, 85/15 within train+val
- Sequences: 528 train / 69 val / 43 test
- `input_steps = 30`, `horizon = 1`
- Training labels: 976 positive of 7,955,406 valid cell-timesteps (0.0123%), same dataset as Run 1
- Loss: Masked Tversky (`alpha=0.3`, `beta=0.7`); Optimizer: Adam, `lr=0.001`
- `epochs = 50` (max), `patience = 10`
- **`batch_size = 1`** (not 8, see caveat above)

**Architecture**

|  | Run 6: M1 Baseline | Run 7: M3 Self-Attention |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gate operator | Standard Conv2d | Patchwise self-attention (layer 1) |
| Attention footprint / dilation | n/a | 7×7, dilation 1 |
| Share planes | n/a | 8 |
| Hidden sizes (layer 1 / 2) | 32 / 16 | 32 / 16 |
| Total parameters | 73,937 | 110,369 |
| Dropout | not reported in this source | not reported in this source |

**Training behaviour**

|  | Run 6: M1 Baseline | Run 7: M3 Self-Attention |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Epochs run | 50 (completed) | 19 (early-stopped, patience 10) |
| Best epoch / best val loss | 44 / 0.318840 | 9 / 0.999788 |
| Selected threshold (val F2) | 0.0000 (F2 = 0.0362) | 0.3933 (F2 = 0.0084) |

Both models spent their first ~19 epochs pinned near val loss 0.999: the Tversky loss's "predict nothing" trivial solution under this class imbalance. The baseline got enough small improvements during that stretch to keep its patience counter alive until it broke out around epoch 20–24, converging to 0.3188 by epoch 27. The self-attention run's last improvement was epoch 9; with no improvement in the next 10, it was early-stopped at epoch 19, **before** reaching the point in training where the baseline broke through the same plateau.

Out of 60 fire cells in the test set, M1 correctly flagged 3 with zero false positives; M3 flagged none and scored exactly at the no-skill PR-AUC floor.

**Notes**
- Not conclusive evidence against attention: M3's early stopping likely triggered right before the plateau breakthrough that M1 needed the same number of extra epochs to reach.

### Run 8: M2 Attention, less restrictive detections, 1 epoch smoke test

**Device:** CUDA (unlike Runs 1–4, which ran on CPU)

**Not a meaningful training result: logged for completeness/traceability, not for comparison.** `Epochs: 1` was the configured max (not an early stop), so the model trained for a single gradient pass over all batches. Its test metrics (128,628 false positives against 89 true positives; Brier 0.2765 vs. ~0.0001–0.001 for fully-trained runs) are consistent with a near-initialization model, not a converged one. Treat this as a smoke test / pipeline sanity check.

**Data**
- Grid: `(730, 142, 200, 7)`; valid cells 14,257 / 28,400 (50.2%), same as all prior runs
- Labels: less restrictive satellite detections, 9,561 positive cells, positive rate 0.1202%, pos_weight ≈ 831.1, **same label source as Run 2**, but not a clean comparison to it (see below)
- Split: legacy 90% ratio → train+val 657 steps / test 73 steps (same as Runs 1–2, 6–7)
- `input_steps = 30` (`Minimum needed: 31`), **differs from Run 2's `input_steps = 15`**, despite sharing the same label source
- Sequences: 528 train / 69 val / 43 test

**Architecture**
- ConvLSTM + patchwise attention (`ATTENTION='patchwise'`), 110,369 total parameters; matches Run 7's M3 architecture exactly (same param count), so presumably the same `footprint=7`, `dilation=1`, `share_planes=8`, `hidden=(32,16)` configuration, though not restated in this log

**Training config**
- Loss: Tversky (`alpha`/`beta` not printed in this log; not confirmed as default here)
- Optimizer: Adam, `lr = 0.001`
- `epochs = 1`, `patience = 10` (irrelevant at 1 epoch)

**Outcome**
- Single epoch: train loss 0.995000, val loss 0.998719, right at the "predict nothing" trivial-solution plateau every other run in this log spent its first ~9–24 epochs stuck in
- Selected threshold: 0.5541 (val F2 = 0.0021, near zero)

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| PR-AUC | 0.0007 |
| Skill (vs no-skill PR-AUC 0.0004) | 1.6x |
| Precision | 0.0007 |
| Recall | 0.3410 |
| F2 | 0.0034 |
| F1 | 0.0014 |
| IoU | 0.0007 |
| Brier | 0.2765 (very poor, see caveat) |
| ROC-AUC | 0.6352 |
| TP / FP / FN / TN | 89 / 128,628 / 172 / 484,162 |
| Test positive rate | 0.0426% (261 of 613,051 cells) |

**Notes**
- High recall (0.3410) is an artifact of broad over-prediction (128,628 false positives), not genuine skill; not a meaningful result given only 1 epoch was trained.
